<h1>OpenAgentKit</h1>

**Building the future of AI agents** ðŸš€

</div>

## Mission

To democratize AI agent development by providing a unified, accessible framework that enables developers to build and deploy intelligent agents across any platform.

## Vision

We envision a world where creating sophisticated AI agents is as simple as building a web application, where the complexity of multi-platform deployment is abstracted away, and where developers can focus on what matters most - creating intelligent solutions that enhance human capabilities.

## Status

**Currently in development** - We are actively building OpenAgentKit and it is not yet open source. Stay tuned for updates!
